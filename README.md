# Health Tracker
### Introduction
Health Tracker is a mobile app which is used to record a patient's SpO2 levels, pulse rate and and body temperature. People suffering from any illness, such as COVID-19 need to record their vitals at regular intervals during the day.
This app can easily be used and recording vitals takes less than 10 seconds. All logged data is stored in an online DB (Firebase).
